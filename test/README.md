# Functional Tests

This directory contains a set of functional tests that compare
AutoValue classes generated with `mavir` against those generated
with the original AutoValue project.

The control classes are built via a small gradle project. The `mavir`
classes are generated against the same sources and compiled the
available `javac` commands.


### Running Tests

Tests are run via the `test.sh` shell script (nothing fancy).
